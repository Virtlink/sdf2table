# SDF2Table
This is the legacy `sdf2table` tool.

To build, invoke `make`. The artifacts will appear in the `dist/` directory.
This build requires Docker.

By default, the artifacts are built for x86-64 Linux.
To build for macOS Big Sur, provide the `HOST` parameter:

```bash
make HOST=x86_64-apple-darwin
```
