This package will contain generated data-structures from basic/Errors and 
some convenience functions.

The data-structures are to be used as:
   - a general error description mechanism in the Meta-Environment
   - a reusable error description mechanism for ASF+SDF specifications


See: http://www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv on installation instructions.
