2003/12/15 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Regenerated both APIs using new apigen. 
 * Added lexical definitions of String and NatCon manually to prevent 
   bottom-sort generation in the parsed API (See lib/Lexicals.sdf)
 * started on utility functions for lifting abstract errors to parsed errors
   and vice versa.

2003/12/04 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Initial version 0.1 of meta-errors package. This package will contain
   generated data-structures from basic/Errors and some convenience functions.
   The data-structures are to be used as:
     - a general error description mechanism in the Meta-Environment
     - a reusable error description mechanism for ASF+SDF specifications
 * Started with generated of imploded api and parse-tree api versions of
   meta-error in lib subdirectory
 * Generation of libraries is completely manual: missing bottom-sorts
   NatCon and String are not generated in the parsed api (manual editing
   of ParsedErrors.h solved this problem temporarily).
