SDF2 Bundle 2.3.2 -- Released 2005-08-26

  This is a minor update of the SDF2 Bundle 2.3. It solves an
  compatibility problem with the latest release of the ATerm Library
  (2.4). Also, this release adds support for pkg-config.

SDF2 Bundle 2.3 -- Released December 23, 2004

  (NEWS selected from Meta-Environment 1.5.2 and 1.5.3 news)

  This is mainly a maintenance release, fixing a number of
  bugs. However, a number of important features have been added.

   * Fixed a bug in obtaining a parse table when restoring brackets
     with a grammar without start symbols.

   * Fixed implosion of alternative literals. "-" | "+" becomes
     alt(1,[]) or alt(2,[]) because a literal does not have a
     representation in an imploded tree. This fixes a core dump

   * The efficiency of the syntax checker was improved
     drastically. This reduces parsetable generation times.

   * A new commandline tool: filterPT. It filters parse forests based
     on some command line arguments. Currently, we have one filter to
     find trees with a maximum or minumum number of occurrences of a
     certain non-terminal. It is used to implement filters for island
     grammars.

   * A new small package: tide-support. Contains a library for
     developing new TIDE debugging adapters.

SDF2 Bundle 2.2 -- Released July 04, 2004

(NEWS selected from Meta-Environment 1.5.1 and 1.5 news)

This release contains many radical improvements of many aspects of
SDF. There are new features, some old features have been replaced by
new features, and some features have become deprecated without
replacement.

   * We advice to turn of injection and prefer/avoid counting. The
     rationale is that these disambiguations silently disambiguate and
     therefore hide important problems of a syntax definition. They
     might also disambiguate in a 'context-sensitive' manner; choosing
     one alternative in some context, and another in a different
     context. Several examples of these effects have lead to the
     decision of turning them off. Please contact us if you are stuck
     with this decision, we can help you. The new behavior in the
     editors is mimicked on the commandline by providing the -fi and
     -fe options to sglr:

     $ sglr -fi -fe -i <input> -o <output>

     So, the standard behaviour of sglr on the commandline has NOT changed.

   * Declaring sorts is obliged for all simple sorts now. The sort
     declarations are used for (and only for) checking typos in sort
     names.

   * Declaring sorts is forbidden for complex symbols (such as tuples,
     lists and optionals).

   * A hidden declaration is now really hidden, just like the
     productions in a hidden section. Before the sdf checker would
     assume a sort that was declared hidden was still declared outside
     of the module.

   * Sort declarations do not make a sort a 'start symbol'
     anymore. Before, all symbols in the sort declaration were
     automatically promoted to start symbols. This lead to unexpected
     ambiguities in a number of cases and to vague warnings and error
     messages by the SDF checker. A sort declaration is now a separate
     concept from a start symbol. Sort declaration declare which sort
     names are going to be used in a grammar, start symbols declare
     the top non-terminals of a grammar.

   * A new grammar type: 'context-free start-symbols' can be used to
     declare a start symbol.

     Example:
     context-free start-symbols
       Compilation-unit 

   * Several more static checks of SDF specifications have been added.

   * Unquoted literals are deprecated. A warning will be printed. Use
     the Upgrade menu to automatically quote all unquoted literals.

   * Tuple syntax A#B is replaced by <A,B> (Upgrade menu)

   * Set and Permutation symbols have been removed.

   * Restore-brackets tool has been improved.

   * {reject} on a language bigger than a literal triggered a bug
     sometimes. This was fixed.

   * Cycles are reported better by sglr and a bug concerning cycles
     has been solved.
